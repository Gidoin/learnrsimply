## Why R for newbies ?

First of all because I am a beginner in R and I want to improve my own R skills. And the best way I found in order to really go back to learning and practising was to give myself this objective : **being able to create a R course for beginners with simple terms and concrete examples.**

This course may be a bit unconventional in its continuity and won't fit for people that already have some coding background. It's more designed for social or political science students without preexisting data science knowledge and it aims to give a good overview of R possibilities with **practical tips, intuitive terms and a step-by-step approach.**

I also want to **make some links between open data and R** and demonstrate with use cases that anyone with basics analytical skills and knowledge on where to find relevant datasets may really take value from open data initiatives.

I hope it will be as useful for others as it is for me. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:timothee.gidoin@sciencespo.fr) in case you have any questions or remarks !

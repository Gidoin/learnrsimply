## A definition of Opengov

OpenGov aims at improving the efficiency and the responsibility of public governance. It affects both national and local authorities.

Three key pillars of Opengov:

1/ Transparency

2/ Accountability

3/ Public participation

The Opengov movement and ideas really increased in the last 10 years, notably through the support of a transnational actor...

The **Open Government Partnership** aka OGP

---

## Open Government Partnership


.center[<img src="./img/ogp.png" height="200"/>] 

In September 2011, a multilateral partnership has been created so as to promote the Open Gov principles and to translate them into concrete public policies : it's called **Open Government Partnership** (OGP)

Initially founded by 8 countries ( Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, United Kingdom, the USA and... **South Africa** !), now OGP is composed of more than 70 countries, including France

---
## Open Government Partnership

How does OGP work ?

To join OGP, a country has to be coopted by other civil society actors (for instance NGO such as Amnesty International) that testify the goodwill of the government

Once joined, the country has to write, by consulting civil society, a 2-years **national action plan** in which many **commitments** are exposed. Those public commitments have to relate with at least one of the 3 key OGP value : information transparency, public participation, accountability of public action

For instance :
+ Developing a participatory budget representing X % of total budget of a local authority

+ Implement an open data strategy that allows to open key datasets 

+ Consult citizens in the wake of a new project law

## Open Government Partnership

> South Africa’s third action plan contained 8 commitments focused on improving public service delivery, budget transparency and access to government data. 4 of the commitments were completed by the midterm review and a further three showed substantial progress. It should be noted that completion activities were carried out prior to the official start of the action plan period for commitments 6 and 8.

> Under the third action plan, South Africa advanced open budgeting and citizen engagement through the launch of the Vuleka Mali open budget portal; the GovChat engagement application; and the extension of citizen-based monitoring at payment points of the South African Social Security Agency. Following significant changes in government administration, which delayed the finalisation of the self-assessment report and development of the fourth action plan, interim arrangements are in place to put the OGP process back on track.The government has requested additional time to prepare a quality fourth action plan.

## OGP and local gov

In 2016, OGP OGP launched the “Subnational Government Pilot Program”

> This decision recognized that many open government innovations and reforms are **happening at the local level** where governments can engage more directly with citizens and many crucial public services are delivered

The Pilot program consisted of 15 “pioneer” subnational governments who signed onto the Open Government Subnational Declaration and submitted their first Action Plans.

Then in 2018, OGP supported the launch of a global Community of Practice on Transparency and Local Open Government within the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)

> This Community of Practice will support peer learning, networking, and wider awareness and capacity development on open governance and public integrity at the local level.

## OGP and local gov

There are currently 20 members in the OGP Local Program. 
> Representing over 74 million citizens, OGP Local members are spread across all regions and illustrate the diversity in types of local governments.

# 1st OpenGov pillar : participation

---

## Participatory budgeting

Do you know what PB deals with ?

--

> Participatory budgeting (PB) is a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making, in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget. Participatory budgeting allows citizens to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.

Participatory budgeting is mainly a tool for local governements. When associated with a political vision, it may represent a substantial amount of money.

According to you, what is the share of Parisian budget that is dedicated to BP ?

--

5% of total budget, that is to say 100 millions euros per year and **500 millions euros over 5 year.**

---

## Participatory budgeting

According to you, what may be the limits of PB ?

--

The **weak representativeness** of people that submit a project and vote : those people are often better educated and wealthier than the average.

The major of Paris was conscious of this issue that's why she decided to **dedicate 1/3rd of total Parisian BP into poor Parisian areas** (mainly districts in the North of Paris) and also to subsidise and organize public workshops to raise awareness among local population living into those poor areas.

.center[<img src= "./img/ogpparis.png" height="250" />]

---

## Consultation platforms

More and more local authorities develop their own debate or consultation platforms in order to boost public participation. Through those platforms (website or apps) citizens are able to suggest new ideas or to express their preferences into public policies. In a way, they are encapsulated into the public decision process !
Example of .red[**idee.paris.fr**] :

.center[<img src= "./img/ideeparis.png" height="300" />]

---

## Consultation platforms

In France, one big private actor is **Cap Collectif**. Its platform allows to :

- Realize consultations
- Realize BP
- Realize and send forms to citizens
- Realize a box of ideas or to launch new projects
- Circulate a petition

.center[<img src= "./img/capco.png" height="250" />]

---

## Consultation platforms

More and more mobile applications are currently developed in order to foster public participation in local governments by collecting the opinions and preferences of local citizens. For instance **Stig** (more tools / initiatives to be presented next session) :

# 2nd OpenGov pillar : accountability

---

## Citizens Budgets

Do you know what citizens budget are about ?

--

> Citizens Budgets are designed to **present key public finance information to a general audience**. They are typically written in accessible language and incorporate visual elements to help non-specialist readers understand the information. 

> Governments should ensure citizens have a firm understanding of the many ways the budget affects their lives. By presenting budget information in a more accessible format than most standard budget documents, **Citizens Budgets foster greater understanding of how public money is being managed.**

> Citizens Budgets should be a gateway to more information. They are not meant to replace more detailed budget documents, but they are important for introducing citizens and civil society to **the knowledge they need to participate as informed stakeholders and hold the government accountable for how it manages public money.**

## Grand Débat National

The *Grand Débat National* is a public debate launched in early 2019 to let every French express their opinions regarding the ecological transition, fiscality, democracy and public services.

.center[[<img src= "./img/granddebat.png" height="400" />](https://granddebat.fr/)]

---

## Grand Débat National

French citizens could not only express their opinions through an online platform (developed by Cap Collectif) but also through **register of grievances** that could be found in most of local town hall. Moreover thousands of local meetings were hold in many areas, including rural ones that used not to be taken into account by national public policies

.center[[<img src= "./img/granddebat1.png" height="350" />](https://www.gouvernement.fr/le-grand-debat-national)]

---

## Grand Débat National

It has been considered as a popular success and a useful tool to boost civic participation into local (and national ?) policy-making. However, the initiative also face strong critics, do you know why ?

--

- Not a transparent platform
- Biased topics and questions ?

## Open data : definition

According to Wikipedia, open data is :
> Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish. One of the most important forms of open data is open government data (OGD), which is a form of open data created by ruling institutions.

**Open data is both a idealogical movement and a practical way of publishing data freely available and usable**

According to [French Government](https://www.gouvernement.fr/action/l-ouverture-des-donnees-publiques) :

> Open data deals with the effort that public organisms do in order to share the data that they own. This opening has to be done **for free, in public format and allow reuse of data**

French law considers that data produced/owned by public administrations/local authorities have to be made available to everyone.

# Open data principles

---
class: middle, center

## 1. Completeness

--

#### Datasets released by the government should be as complete as possible, .red[reflecting the entirety of what is recorded] about a particular subject. 

#### All raw information from a dataset should be released to the public, .red[except to private information] and information that may be sensitive for .red[national safety]

---
class: middle, center

## 2. Primacy / Raw data

--

####  Datasets released by the government should be .red[primary source data]

---
class: middle, center

## 3. Timely data

--

#### Datasets released by the government should be available to the public .red[as soon as possible]

---
class: middle, center

##  4. Ease of Physical and Electronic Access

--

#### Datasets released by the government should be as accessible as possible, with accessibility defined as .red[the ease with which information can be obtained], whether through physical or electronic means

---
class: middle, center

## 5. Machine readability

--

####  Machines can handle certain kinds of inputs much better than others. Information shared in the widely-used PDF format, for example, is very difficult for machines to parse

#### Thus, information should be stored in widely-used file formats that easily lend themselves to machine processing.

---
class: middle, center

## 6. Non-discriminatory access to data

--

#### “Non-discrimination” refers to who can access data and how they must do so

#### Non-discriminatory access to data means that .red[any person can access the data at any time without having to identify him/herself] or provide any justification for doing so.

---
class: middle, center

## 7. Open standards

--

#### Open standards refer to who owns the format in which data is stored

Do you know a widespread proprietary format ?

--

#### Microsoft .red[Excel] is a fairly commonly-used spreadsheet program which costs money to use. Freely available alternative formats often exist by which stored data can be accessed without the need for a software license

---

## 8. Open Licence 

--

#### Maximal openness includes clearly .red[labeling public information] as a work of the government and .red[available without restrictions on use] as part of the public domain

#### In France two type of licences : .red[Licence Ouverte (CC-BY)] ou .red[ODBL (CC-BY-SA)]. what is the difference ?

- **LO (from Etalab) / ODBL** : with both you can share, edit the database, create derived products and had a commercial usage

- **LO** : more "permissive" : you just have to mention the source and the date of update

- **ODBL** : you have to share and open your database at the same conditions

---
## Open Data : to go further

Find [the 8 principles of Open Government Data](https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html) that were adopted in Sebastopol December 2007

.center[![](img/sunlightfoundation.png)]

Then in 2010 this list was slightly completed and updated ([10 principes](https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/documents/ten-open-data-principles/)) by the Sunlight Foundation.

In 2013 the Sunlight Foundation wrote instructions and recommandations to implement concretely Open Data (["Open Data guidelines"](http://sunlightf.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OpenDataGuidelines_v3.pdf)) based on those 10 principles

It was designed and inaugurated in 2011, by the **Etalab** mission, and then refreshed in 2013.
.center[<img src="./img/datagouvfr.png" height="250"/>] 

There are thousands of datasets (but not only) coming from different type of public data producers such as Ministries, independent agencies, statistical institutes, local authorities but also third parties producers such as OpenStreetMap or OpenFoodFacts

## Beyond national OD platform

Data.gouv Portal is French **national** Open data platform but it's not the only website that publishes available public datasets. Do you know others ?

--

+ There are also OD platforms led by **local authorities** at different levels. For instance, [Paris Data](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/?sort=modified), [la Région Occitanie](https://data.laregion.fr/pages/accueil/), [l'agglomération de Saint-Malo](https://data.stmalo-agglomeration.fr/page/accueil/)...

--

+ Open Data platforms led by **ministries**. Example : [data.education.gouv.fr](https://data.education.gouv.fr/pages/accueil/)

--

+ Open Data plaftorms led by **private organizations**. Example [DataNova](https://datanova.laposte.fr/page/accueil/) (La Poste)

--

+ Datasets directly published in data provider website, without dedicated platform. Example : Insee

## Challenge 1 : data findability

> Data findability is a major challenge. We have data portals and registries, but government agencies under one national government still publish data in different ways and different locations.(…)
**Data findability is a prerequisite for open data to fulfill its potential and currently most data is very hard to find.**

## Challenge 1 : data findability

According to you, how can we improve data findability ?

--

**It is necessary to document/fill properly the metadata**, that is to say the descriptive data associated to a dataset. For instance :

--

+ Data producer
+ Date of first publication
+ Update frequency
+ Date of last update
+ Description of the dataset
+ Variables explanation
+ Topics / tags
+ Time and space coverage (year, area, segmentation)

(*This list is not exhaustive*)

## Challenge 1 : data findability

Summer 2017, Datactivist realized a census of all the datasets opened by 15 major French cities (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Nantes...). More than 400 datasets were listed but identifying them was not easy at all...

## Challenge 1 : data findability

Thus,
> ** Half of the descriptions of data opened by local authorities were written with less than 180 caracters** and only 4% of the datasets had a description abova 1000 caracters

Beyond very short descriptions, another challenge is to **detail the name of the variables**. Often they contain acronyms that make sense for public agents but can't be understood by common citizens.

In the exemple next slide, [l'enquête Etic du Ministère de l'éducation nationale](https://data.education.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/fr-en-etic_1d/table/), many columns have labeled hardly readable such as "SiEquipementInf" ou "Maint_PersEducHEcole" but the data producer made the effort to detail each of them in the metadata

## Challenge 2 : data quality


> **Government data is usually incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented.** In most cases, open data catalogues or portals are manually fed as the result of informal data management approaches. **Procedures, timelines, and responsibilities are frequently unclear among government institutions tasked with this work.**

OpenDataBarometer ?

> It's a global measure of how governments are publishing and using open data for accountability, innovation and social impact. The Leaders Edition looks at the 30 governments that have adopted the Open Data Charter and those that, as G20 members, have committed to G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles.

## Bonus : Tidy data

[*Tidy data principles*](https://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/) ("données ordonnées")
- Each variable in the data set is placed in its own column
- Each observation is placed in its own row
- Each value is placed in its own cell
